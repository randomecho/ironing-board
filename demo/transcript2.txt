matthewmccullough   Class notes are ready at: http://teach.github.com/classnotes/2013-02-26-g...
And will be expanded after class today.
matthewmccullough   Morning Matt Yoho! Glad to have you here again helping us.
Matt Y. Good morning!
matthewmccullough   Class notes are all ready: http://teach.github.com/classnotes/2013-02-26-g...
More will be added at the end of class today, but that's the canonical link.
Jim A.  on a pull request- what if there are conflicts?
Matt Y. Jim: If there are conflicts on a pull request, they will have to be resolved manually locally first, then have the merge commit that resolves them pushed up to the Pull Request branch.
Matt Y. The PR will then apply cleanly and can be closed through the GitHub UI. But in practice those conflicts are relatively infrequent.
Jim A.  thx
matthewmccullough   Class notes are ready: http://teach.github.com/classnotes/2013-02-26-g...
AL  Had to go into .git/config and change http to https to reset password to use HTTPS to push? Any ideas why?
Bill    Thanks.
Rajesh P.   Hello
Good Morning
Matt Y. AL: GitHub won't accept password-authenticated requests over non-SSL protected HTTP.
Good morning, Rajesh.
Justin C.   Will there be any information about deployment?
matthewmccullough   http://training.github.com/web/git-foundations/
Ilya    were any notes emailed yesterday? i haven't received anything
Matt Y. Course notes for yesterday and today: http://teach.github.com/classnotes/2013-02-26-g...
Ilya    thank you
Matt Y. Np!
Daniel K.   Do you have a transcription of yesterday's chat?
Matt Y. Daniel: I'm afraid not, I think. The free Campfire rooms don't track transcripts. Sorry!
Daniel K.   Bummer. That was one benefit of the GoToMeeting chat room.
Seth    If I reset --hard HEAD why would my branch be ahead of master by 1 commit still?
Bill    How do I get my Mac Terminal to use same colors as Matthew's.
Matt Y. Seth: If you haven't pushed that HEAD commit up to GitHub yet, your local repo will still be one commit ahead.

Daniel K.   Terrific. Thx.
Matt Y. Sorry for the misinformation!
Daniel K.   np

Randy C.    how long does it stay in effect.
Matt Y. Randy: How long does the metadata recalculation in the log listing stay in effect?
It's a one-time thing, it isn't cached or stored.
So every time you want to see that view of the history you have to specify the flags.
Randy C.    if I use -C once do I have to keep using it?
Matt Y. Yep, you do.
But you only need it when you want to see that "perspective" on the history.
Randy C.    ok he said 'turns on' and thought it was forever.
Matt Y. Right, gotcha. No, that was just a slightly loose manner of speaking.
Bill    Do you have a document that list all the optional command line parameters for a command (i.e. -u, -A, etc)?
Ruben M.    I assume that git reset --hard is not undoable. correct?
Matt Y. Bill: One quick reference in addition to the only documentation, Git comes with traditional man pages.
matthewmccullough   http://git-scm.com/docs/git-add/1.7.5
Matt Y. Looking up specific commands takes a specific form. To check the documentation, including all the flags, for say `git log`, you would check `man git-log`.
matthewmccullough   http://teach.github.com/cheatsheets/
http://teach.github.com/articles/git-cheatsheets/
Matt Y. Ruben: A `git reset --hard` isn't really undoable, no.
Jeff K. Bill: man pages are usually accessible via the --help flag as well (tho for some reason this doesnt work on my windows installation): git add --help (or generically: git <command> --help)
Alejandro G.    offtopic: how can you know what is going to be update by a git pull command?
Daniel K.   git log origin/master..master
Alejandro G.    nice
Matt Y. Daniel: That's a good thought, but doesn't quite work.
Daniel K.   Oops < sorry that's going to tell what will be pushed
Matt Y. What Matthew is talking about now is related to Alejandro's question.
We'll make sure to address it in a moment when Matthew finishes his point.
matthewmccullough   git reset --hard origin/master
Alejandro G.    nice fetch is was i was looking for :D
Richard S.  so is it just changing what is "head" then?
Matt Y. Richard S: Not exactly. HEAD refers to the latest commit in your current branch. What `fetch` does is pull over the local copies of the remote branches that mirror your local ones.
Phillip J.  so, git fetch requires me to still have to git pull
Daniel K.   If I do something like switch core.autocrlf from true to false, what would I need to do to ensure my local working files are adjusted accordingly? A new clone?
Richard S.  ah I see
Matt Y. Phillip: It turns out that git pull is a shortcut for git fetch and another command, git merge. We'll take in more detail a bit later.
*talk
Phillip J.  ok thank you
Pream T 
# On branch master
# Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 3 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
#
Matt Y. Daniel: Let me get back to you on that in a few, I want to make sure we follow up on the question Alejandro raised earlier.
But in short, changing a setting like that will only affect files you change and commit, not files already in the repo.
David R.    what is the difference between git fetch and git remote update (is there any?)
Cheri V.    After a git fetch, I do a git pull and it says everything is already up to date.
Matt Y. David: With only one remote, they're equivalent.
AL  After Fetch, wouldn't it be good to do a diff?
Matt Y. AL: You may want to do that, but even with a conflict, you will probably have to merge it.
In practice it's okay to skip that.
David R.    After git merge, I got: fatal: No commit specified and merge.defaultToUpstream not set.
Matt Y. David: Could you paste the command you ran?
David R.    I edited fix.txt in the browser, committed, it, then: git fetch
then git merge
Matt Y. Alejandro asked a few moments ago, "how can you know what is going to be updated by a git pull command?"
Daniel K.   David do: git merge origin/master
jcamou  is it a good practice to always do a pull before push?
David R 
> git status
# On branch master
# Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
#
nothing to commit, working directory clean
git merge origin/master
Justin C.   Can you give a quick example of why you'd want to do a fetch instead of a pull?
Bill    So Origin is Remote, not Upstream. Correct?
Alejandro G.    ok understood, thx for the clarification matt
Matt Y. Justin: Primarily if you wanted to review what would be automatically merged in by running pull.
jcamou: Yes, it is; though if you haven't done a pull, and there are changes on the remote, your push will be rejected with a message telling you to pull.
jcamou  Thank you, Matt.
Justin C.   Thanks
Matt Y. Bill: origin is the name of the primary/default remote.
"Upstream" is a general term referring to a remote.
Daniel K.   Wasn't prompted but using new version.
git version 1.8.1.msysgit.1 
$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 2), reused 3 (delta 2)

error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
		Copyofother1.txt
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
Aborting
Jon G.  I have the same and wasn't prompted.
jcamou  what wouldÂ´ve happened if both changes were done at the bottom?
Pream T.    may it be a windows/powershell thing?
AL  Auto-merging... cursor is just hung in console
Editing done and saved.
ah
was it
matthewmccullough   git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --decorate --all -5
Richard S.  Matt, my merge failed, it says "Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit results."
Matt Y. Richard: It may be the case that the files were changed in the same place in the remote and local versions.
Matt Y. If you run git diff now, what does it look like?
Daniel K.   How do I merge?
Richard S.  it shows the changes of my one liner on local and the change on server
Daniel K 
$ git merge origin/master
Updating 9f6b991..e394d83
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
		Copyofother1.txt
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.

David R.    in that git log graph output, origin/master and origin/head are red, does that mean anything?
Matt Y. David: No, there's no special meaning to those colors.
Daniel K.   Duh!
David R.    okay good.
AL  difference between origin/master origin/HEAD in log --graph?
jcamou  how do you set the default branch on the cli_
?
copy.
Matt Y. Richard: You could paste the output of the diff if you'd like.
Richard S.  sure
Richard S 
$ git diff
diff --cc fix.txt

+ This is done serverside
+ put something bottom on serverside
++>>>>>>> e3364b8777e0408a77f0fb36ea19a541697630ed
Alejandro G.    so if my default branch in server is master, origin/master == origin/HEAD?
Richard S.  in this case is it best to just reset my changes since changes locally are in the same spot as server?
Matt Y. Richard: The local change needed to be the very top line to avoid the conflict. Those changes weren't on the same line, but were close enough for git to consider them a potential conflict.
Alejandro: Yep.
Randy C.    What does this mean 
error: The requested URL returned error: 403 while accessing https://github.com/
githubtraining/hellogitworld.git/info/refs
fatal: HTTP request failed
Richard S.  ok thanks
Matt Y. Richard: As Matthew just said, you can just wait a bit. :-)
Richard S.  :)
Alejandro G.    403 is forbidden
Randy C.    Is that a standard http error number?
Matt Y. Randy: Yep.
Richard S.  i had that yesterday Alejandro , are you using your fork?
Alejandro G.    yep
Matt Y. Randy: That is possibly happening because your remote is set up with an http url instead of https.
You can look in the contents of ./.git/config to inspect the remote URL.
I'll be back after the break.
Nazila N.   Randy: had the problem yesterday which was resolved for me by adding adding my "username@github.com/...." in the URL line in for .git/config
Daniel K.   Maybe this can be asked now? ... If I do something like switch core.autocrlf from true to false, what would I need to do to ensure my local working files are adjusted accordingly? A new clone?
Right
Right
You're confirming my thinking.
thx
We made the mistake of choosing true and our whole team needs to make the switch
jcamou  commit -a is add_
?
Matt Y. jcamou: Yep.
jcamou  beautiful.
Matt Y. It's simple add, no flags.
Matt Y. Red + blue == purple :-D
Ruben M.    There are some pretty sophisticated apps that help you resolve conflicts, such as BeyondCompare. How can we use them?
Matt Y. Ruben: Matthew is going to talk about using graphical merge tools shortly.
matthewmccullough   git difftool --tool-help
Randy C.    we saw a diagram of local & remote but where does base fit into to this picture?
Ruben M.    thx
matthewmccullough   https://github.com/matthewmccullough/dotfiles
Bill    Does SmartGib or Tower include diff/merge tools with comparable functionality? How about IDE diff/merge tools?
Cheri V.    For people who have to deal with a large number of merge conflicts (merging two versions of an OS for example), is there a way to "farm out" the merge conflicts so that multiple people can help resolve them?
Bill    Do the IDEs (i.e. IntelliJ) have visual diff/merge tool that is comparable to Araxis?
Thank you.
Daniel K.   Modified date in Windows changes.
Jim A.  what did she say?
sorry, *he
nvm, I saw it
Nazila N.   sorry - what was "-u" switch ? (in push)
Phillip J.  so it's possible to publish a local branch to a different origin branch name
what's the use case for that
Matt Y. Nazila: It tells git to remember the remote branch you pushed to, so that pulls will work afterward.
Nazila: It tells the local branch you are pushing to "track" the remote branch you're creating in the future.
Nazila N.   thanks Matt
Matt Y. Nazila: You're welcome. Feel free to ask for further clarification.
Phillip J.  could you show your zsh history once
one more time
Bill    Could you clarify what is "origin", the local cache of GitHub or actually GitHub?
matthewmccullough 
10109  git branch featurework2
10112  git add -u .
10114  git commit -m"Deleted all of the things"
10115  git branch
10116  git status
10120  git checkout -b iwanttotrythisthing
10122  git branch -d iwanttotrythisthing
10123  git checkout featurework2
10124  git push -u origin featurework2
10125  git checkout master
10126  git merge featurework2
10127  git push
Bill    Thank you.
Phillip J.  can we alias that
e.g. another remote with a name other than origin
Matt Y. Phillip: You can rename remotes if you like. "origin" is the default name for the first remote.
Phillip J.  thanks
matthewmccullough   git config --global alias.logfive ="log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --decorate --all -5"
John H. git config --global alias.logfive ="log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --decorate --all -5"
Sorry
jcamou  white space
matthewmccullough   git config --global alias.logfive "log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --decorate --all -5"
Daniel K.   Removing an alias?
Bill    When I typed your original version a small blue bird starting flying on my screen. How do I turn it off?
Just Joking...
Alejandro G.    you can open the .gitconfig to inspect it and add there what you want or remove it
matthewmccullough   https://githubtraining.campfirenow.com/7051f
Daniel K.   Looks like: git config --global --unset alias.s
Daniel K.   Can you use rebasing to change the commit comment of an older commit (not just the last)?
Matt Y. Daniel: Yep!
AL  should we rebase before pushing to origin?
Jim A.  rebasing will combine all of your local commits?
Daniel K.   fix your repo
Matt Y. Jim: That *can* be done, but isn't the default.
Seth    not sure I understand the rebase before sharing... why shouldn't I rebase a branch, commit, push, and alert coworkers to pull the newly rebased branch?
Matt Y. Seth: Because rebasing changes the history of commits, you would cause your coworkers later changes to be conflicts, as well as potentially duplicate commits.
Seth: Once a commit has been shared, it shouldn't be changed.
Alejandro G.    ok pple i have to leave now, its been a great learning time. Cheers all and keep the good work comming!
Matt Y. Seth: Now, it *is* possible to "pull and rebase" but in general that workflow takes a lot more diligence than its payoff.
Alejandro: Thanks for participating!
Seth    so how might two separate people work on a long term feature branch (that will at some point involve a rebase before merge)?
Alejandro G.    thx for all, matt and matthew both of you are good teachers hope we can meet in the advanced course :D!
Matt Y. Alejandro: Thanks! See you around.
Daniel K.   Why do people bad mouth using "git stash"?
Phillip J.  this.
Daniel K.   Isn't is like creating a local branch?
Phillip J.  can we effectively pop 4 or 5 working ideas into the same branch
or do they overwrite each other
k
Daniel K.   git branch will show a generic branch
I love git stash
Phillip J.  can you cat a stash and port it to another box, say like my laptop
gotcha
Daniel K.   So you can git reset --hard MYTAG
Ruben M 
I have a general question:
How secure is the code in GitHub? I understand there is no encrypt option or something like that, at least for some files.
Daniel K.   This is only available from GitHub, not just any Git repo, right?
Matt Y. --show-signature
Cheri V.    Is there any help for how to merge from svn to git while preserving history?
Daniel K.   How to create a branch from a tag?
Rajesh P.   is there a advanced class too ?
Jeff K. Great training. Thanks fellas.
David R.    see you for the advanced class
Daniel K.   :thumbsup
Ruben M.    Excellent class
matthewmccullough   http://help.github.com/security/
Tom H.  Is it possible to delete repositories? I belive locally you can remove the .git file and/or the directory- but server side?
David R.    Rajesh: http://training.github.com/web/advanced-git/
Matt Y. Daniel: Which feature were you asking about, whether or was a git or GitHub feature?
Tom H.  Thanks.
Bill    When using IDE git integration, do you switch (and create a new branch) from inside the IDE, or do you need to do it outside IDE?
Daniel K.   Matt < the SVN trick
Matt Y. Bill: You can do it either way.
Daniel K.   Matthew, thx
Matt Y. Daniel: Gotcha. Any SVN repo can be converted to a git repo, it's just a matter of processing.
Dan If I need to go back to a previously commit in a branch, several commits ago, how do I do that?
Bill    Thank you. I'm assuming that's also true for IntelliJ?
Thank you.
Matt Y. Daniel: It's also possible and pretty common to create a git repo locally and then push it up to GitHub.
Cheri V.    Is there a good reference for how to convert from svn to git while preserving history?
Dan how about both? :)
Daniel K.   I meant, can you "svn checkout" from any git repo, or only from a GitHub repo?
Bill    Thank you for all the hard work in preparing and delivering this class. Very much appreciated.
Matt Y. Cheri: Here's a helpful article on SVN => git conversion https://help.github.com/articles/importing-from...
Bill: On behalf of Matthew, thank you, and thanks for participating.
Nazila N.   Thank you very much to both of you.
Jim A.  thx guys!
Wouter K.   Thanks, great info! See you for the advanced class.
Matt Y. Daniel: Oh, my mistake. Yes, that's a GitHub feature. It may be replicated elsewhere but isn't standard.
matthewmccullough   http://teach.github.com/classnotes/2013-02-26-g...
Richard S.  much thanks. Matthew and Matt!
Justin C.   Thanks!
Matt Y. Thanks everyone, enjoy your day!
matthewmccullough   It was our pleasure to be able to share Git and GitHub knowledge with you.
Thanks for giving us your time!
